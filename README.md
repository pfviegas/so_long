# so_long
## And thanks for all the fish!

The so_long project is a game development challenge in which we are tasked with creating a 2D tile-based game using the C programming language. 

The game typically involves designing a simple, retro-style game with graphics and user interaction.

We are responsible for implementing features such as character movement, collision detection, enemies or obstacles, and scoring. We have to handle graphics and rendering, often using the librarie MiniLibX.

The project serves as an introduction to game development, helping learn about game design, user interaction, and the basics of graphical programming. It reinforces understanding of C programming and encourages creativity in designing and implementing a fun and engaging game within the constraints of the project's requirements.
